# Bike-vs-Car
We have trained a **Deep Learning Model** to classify images of **Bikes** and **Cars**.

We have fine-tuned 3 models from the pretrained **VGG16**, **MobileNetV3Small** and **MobileNetV3Large** models to achieve our goals.

The **Accuracy** achieved by each of the 3 models are as follows:

  **1. VGG16:** 99.02% (vgg16.h5)
  
  **2. MobileNetV3Small:** 98.37% (mob_small.h5)
  
  **3. MobileNetV3Large:** 96.08% (mob_large.h5)
